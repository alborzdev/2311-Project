# 2311-Project (TAB2MXL)
This project is for the EECS2311 course at York University.

This repository contains a Java application that converts ASCII drum/guitar/bass tablature (.txt) to a MusicXML (.xml) file using a simple and intuitive GUI.
To get started, clone the master branch and run the software on Eclipse with Gradle. Please refer to the User Manual in the documentation folder for more details on installing and running the software.

### Disclaimer
For the midterm submission (03/17/2021), guitar tab conversion has been implemented with the restriction of key signature **C Major** and time signatures **4/4 and 3/4**. The drum and bass tabs are currently in the parsing stage, and we are still in the testing stages of the project.

## Getting Started and Installation
To get started, clone the master branch and run the application as a `Gradle` project. Please make sure that you set Java 15 for your compiler compliance level:
`File → Properties → Java Compiler → Compiler Compliance Level → 15`
